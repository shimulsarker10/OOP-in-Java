# Assignment on Object-Oriented Programming in Java
A simple command line interface where one can mange restaurant...
## According to the instruction:
Objective:
To develop a real-world Java application that demonstrates classes, objects, constructors,
encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, method overloading, method overriding, file
handling, exception handling, abstract classes, and interfaces. Additionally, students must
provide a use case diagram and explain their implementation approach.

Client Requirement:
A restaurant wants a Restaurant Management System to handle customer orders, manage
employees, and generate reports. The system must include the following functionalities:
1. Customer Management:
○ Customers can place orders.
○ Each customer has a unique customerId, name, and phoneNumber.
2. Menu and Orders:
○ The restaurant has multiple food items, each with a foodId, name, and price.
○ Customers can place orders that contain multiple food items.
○ Each order has an orderId, customerId, orderedItems, and totalPrice.
3. Employee Management:
○ There are two types of employees: Manager and Waiter, both inheriting from
Employee.
○ Each employee has an empId, name, and salary.
○ The Manager gets a bonus of 20% of their salary.
○ The Waiter gets a bonus of 10% of their salary.
4. Exception Handling:
○ Ensure that invalid inputs (e.g., negative prices, missing names) are handled
properly.

5. Polymorphism & Abstraction:
○ Implement an abstract class Employee with an abstract method
calculateBonus().

○ Implement an interface Printable with a method printDetails(), which is
implemented by all key classes (Customer, Order, Employee).

Assignment Requirements:
1. Develop a Java program that implements the above system.
2. Create a Use Case Diagram representing how customers, employees, and orders interact
in the system.
3. Write a short report (300-500 words) explaining:
○ How the concepts of OOP (Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism,
Abstraction) are used.
○ The role of file handling and exception handling in your implementation.
○ Challenges faced and how they were overcome.
